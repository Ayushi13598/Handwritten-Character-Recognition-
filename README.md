# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-
A deep learning project to predict the handwritten character.

About Dataset:
The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19  and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset. 
There are six different splits provided in this dataset.
I have used: EMNIST Balanced:  131,600 characters. 47 balanced classes.
The EMNIST Balanced dataset is meant to address the balance issues in the ByClass and ByMerge datasets. It is derived from the ByMerge dataset to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. This dataset is meant to be the most applicable.

train: 112,800
test: 18,800
total: 131,600
classes: 47 (balanced)
